# React + Vite

We can follow the following folder structure for creating react-redux project files
src/
  store/
    store.js
    reducer.js
  components/
    Counter.js
  App.js
  index.js


<!-- 1. `src/store/store.js`: This file contains the Redux store setup. -->
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
